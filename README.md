# Battle-card
一个来自中国的十一岁小学生的一个小游戏。;A small game of an 11-year-old primary school student from China.

此游戏为在学校中由同学发明的一个卡牌游戏为灵感。;This game is inspired by a card game invented by students in school.

在此游戏中，抽到的卡牌分三类：攻击、治疗、护盾，（以后还可能会增加一种控制类型）每一类卡牌有对应的物品，如攻击类目前有‘ak47’、‘m416’等。人物也有三种数值：生命值、护盾值、步数（可以理解为其他游戏中的能量值，使用物品需要消耗能量值）。初始生命值为100，护盾值为0，步数为0。每回合可以选择消耗步数使用物品或者积攒步数，如果有一方没有卡片或只有步枪卡片，将再次为他抽卡。直到一方的生命值为0，游戏结束，另一方获胜。;
In this game, the cards drawn are divided into three types: attack, treatment and shield. (A control type may be added later) Each type of card has corresponding items, such as' ak47 'and' m416 '. The character also has three kinds of values: health value, shield value, and number of steps (which can be understood as energy value in other games, and the use of items requires energy value). The initial health value is 100, the shield value is 0, and the number of steps is 0. Each round can choose to consume steps to use items or accumulate steps. If a party has no cards or only rifle cards, it will draw cards for him again. Until one party's HP is 0, the game ends and the other party wins.
