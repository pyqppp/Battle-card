# Battle-card

A small game of an 11-year-old primary school student from China.

This game is inspired by a card game invented by students in school.

In this game, the cards drawn are divided into three types: attack, treatment and shield. (A control type may be added later) Each type of card has corresponding items, such as' ak47 'and' m416 '. The character also has three kinds of values: health value, shield value, and number of steps (which can be understood as energy value in other games, and the use of items requires energy value). The initial health value is 100, the shield value is 0, and the number of steps is 0. Each round can choose to consume steps to use items or accumulate steps. If a party has no cards or only rifle cards, it will draw cards for him again. Until one party's HP is 0, the game ends and the other party wins.

Special thanks to Wang Jincheng for his inspiration.
