# Battle-card

A small game of an 11-year-old primary school student from China.

This game is inspired by a card game invented by students in school.

In this game, the cards drawn are divided into four categories: attack, health, shield, and control. Each type of card has a corresponding item, such as the attack category, which currently includes' ak47 ',' m416 ',' p18c ', etc. There are also three types of numerical values for characters: health, shield, step count (which can be understood as energy points in other games, and items require energy consumption), and control. The initial health value is 100, the shield value is 0, the number of steps is 0, and the controlled value is 0. Each turn can choose to consume steps to use weapons or accumulate steps, provided that the controlled value is equal to 0. If it is greater than 0, this turn will be skipped until one party's health is 0. The game ends and the other party wins.

Special thanks to Wang Jincheng for his inspiration.
